    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>I’ve lived my whole life in Oregon and graduated from Ridgeview High School in June of 2023. I am a first year student at OSU Cascades and am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I have taken an internship working for the Redmond School District’s technical support team, which I took for two summers. Most of my educational experience is in math and technology, and I have taken several advanced math and computer coding courses. I live in Redmond with my family and enjoy the atmosphere of the outdoors as much as developing and writing at my computer desk.</p>
